Yet Another Minimal UI - yamui

Small application to draw progress bar, logo, text or short animations to the
screen. Suitable for minimal environments where there are no other frambuffer
users. E.g. in initrd or early boot process splash screens.

See os-update.h and minui.h for the API.

The yamui expects that the PNG image files for animation and logo have
are placed under /res/images/ folder. Use non-interlaced PNG pictures.

For more info on the command line tool, run

yamui --help
